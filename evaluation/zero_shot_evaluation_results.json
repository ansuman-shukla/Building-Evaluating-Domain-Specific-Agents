    "task_description": "I need to add 3/4 + 2/5. Can you help me solve this step by step?",
    "response": "Okay, let's solve the addition problem 3/4 + 2/5 step-by-step.\n\n**1. Analyze the problem:**\n\nWe are asked to add two fractions: 3/4 and 2/5. To add fractions, they need to have a common denominator.\n\n**2. Break it down into smaller components:**\n\n*   **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators (4 and 5):** The LCM will be our common denominator.\n*   **Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator.**\n*   **Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions.**\n*   **Simplify the resulting fraction if possible.**\n\n**3. Solve each component:**\n\n*   **Find the LCM of 4 and 5:**\n    *   Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, **20**, 24...\n    *   Multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, **20**, 25...\n    *   The LCM of 4 and 5 is 20.\n\n*   **Convert 3/4 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20:**\n    *   To get from 4 to 20, we multiply by 5.\n    *   Multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5: (3 * 5) / (4 * 5) = 15/20\n\n*   **Convert 2/5 to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20:**\n    *   To get from 5 to 20, we multiply by 4.\n    *   Multiply both the numerator and denominator by 4: (2 * 4) / (5 * 4) = 8/20\n\n*   **Add the numerators of the equivalent fractions:**\n    *   15/20 + 8/20 = (15 + 8) / 20 = 23/20\n\n**4. Combine the solutions:**\n\nWe've found that 3/4 is equivalent to 15/20 and 2/5 is equivalent to 8/20.  Adding these gives us 23/20.\n\n**5. Provide the final answer:**\n\nThe answer is 23/20. This is an improper fraction (the numerator is larger than the denominator).  It can also be written as a mixed number: 1 and 3/20.",
