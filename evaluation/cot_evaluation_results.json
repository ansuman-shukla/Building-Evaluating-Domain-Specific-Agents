    "task_description": "I need to add 3/4 + 2/5. Can you help me solve this step by step?",
    "response": "Okay, let's break down the addition of 3/4 + 2/5 step by step.\n\n**1. Analyze the Problem**\n\nWe are adding two fractions: 3/4 and 2/5.  Fractions represent parts of a whole. To add fractions, they need to have the same denominator (the bottom number).\n\n**2. Break it Down into Smaller Components**\n\nTo add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The steps are:\n\n*   **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators:** The denominators are 4 and 5.\n*   **Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator:** This means we need to multiply the numerator and denominator of each fraction by a number that will result in the common denominator.\n*   **Add the numerators:** Once the fractions have the same denominator, we add the numerators.\n*   **Simplify (if necessary):** Reduce the resulting fraction to its simplest form, if possible.\n\n**3. Solve Each Component**\n\n*   **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 4 and 5:**\n\n    *   The multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, **20**, 24...\n    *   The multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, **20**, 25...\n    *   The least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 5 is 20.\n\n*   **Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 20:**\n\n    *   For 3/4:  We need to multiply the denominator (4) by 5 to get 20.  So, we also multiply the numerator (3) by 5:  (3/4) * (5/5) = 15/20\n    *   For 2/5: We need to multiply the denominator (5) by 4 to get 20. So, we also multiply the numerator (2) by 4: (2/5) * (4/4) = 8/20\n\n*   **Add the numerators:**\n\n    *   Now we have 15/20 + 8/20.  Add the numerators (15 + 8) and keep the common denominator (20):\n        15/20 + 8/20 = (15 + 8)/20 = 23/20\n\n*   **Simplify (if necessary):**\n\n    *   The fraction 23/20 is an improper fraction (the numerator is larger than the denominator).  We can convert it to a mixed number, but it's not strictly necessary.  23/20 is already in its simplest form, as 23 and 20 have no common factors other than 1. We can leave it as an improper fraction or convert it to a mixed number (1 3/20).\n\n**4. Combine the Solutions**\n\nWe found that 3/4 is equivalent to 15/20 and 2/5 is equivalent to 8/20.  Adding them gives us 23/20.\n\n**5. Provide the Final Answer**\n\nTherefore, 3/4 + 2/5 = 23/20 or 1 3/20.",
